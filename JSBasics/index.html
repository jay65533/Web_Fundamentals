            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross platform, object-oriented programming language. JavaScript is extremely
            popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility
            for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment
            (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide
            programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp">Variable Declaration</a>
                    JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee,
                    the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified
                    with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.<span class="ul_color">var x;</span> 
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_assignment.asp">Variable Assignment</a>
                    Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee
                    poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a 
                    value to a variable. <span class="ul_color">var x = 10;</span>
                    
                </li>

                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp">Data Types</a>
                    Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know
                    the data type. There are six datatypes that are JavaScript primitives; Boolean -<span class="ul_color">true</span>or<span class="ul_color">false;</span>
                    null -<span class="ul_color">null</span>aka nothing; Number -<span class="ul_color">42</span>or<span class="ul_color">3.14159;</span>String -<span class="ul_color">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>Array - 
                    <span class="ul_color">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span>and Object -<span class="ul_color">{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span>
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp">Conditionals</a>
                    When you write code you want to perform different actions for different decisions - 
                    hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can 
                    use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this:<span class="ul_color">if</span>a specified condition is true, do 
                    this code in our code block;<span class="ul_color">else if</span>to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;<span class="ul_color">else</span>we execute this line of code; 
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp">Loops</a>
                    There are many different kind of loops in every programming language, but they all
                    essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine
                    you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times them you stop. Thats a 
                    loop.
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp">Function</a>
                    Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that 
                    code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together 
                    a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table 
                    top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton
                    more tables to do so lets call our function over and over again.
