            <h3>Clients and Servers</h3>
            <p class = "clients">Computers connected to the <span>Web</span> are called <strong>clients</strong> and <strong>servers</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="blue">Clients</span> are the typical Web
                    user's Internet-connected device (for example, your
                    computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected
                    to your mobile network) and
                    <span class="blue">Web-accessing software</span>
                    available on those devices (usually a web browser like
                    Firefox on Chrome).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="blue">Servers</span> are the computers
                    that store <span class="blue">webpages</span>,
                    <span class="blue">sites</span>, or <span class="blue">apps</span>.
                    When a client wants to access a webpage, a copy of the
                    webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client
                    machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.
                </li>

            <h3>So What Actually Happens?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The browser goes to the <span class="blue">DNS server</span>
                    and finds the real address of the <span class="blue">server</span>
                    that the website lives on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The browser send an <span class="blue">HTTP request</span>
                    message to the server asking it to send a copy of the website to the client.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a
                    <span class="blue">"200 OK" message</span>, which means
                    "Permission granted! Here you go!", and then start sending the website's
                    files to the browser as a series of small chunks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and
                    displays it to you!
